 The Bookmarks feature in a web browser enables users to store their preferred links for easy retrieval at a later time. Rather than having to search for a particular website or re-enter its URL, users can save it with a single click. Additionally, this feature allows users to categorize links into folders, facilitating easier access to content based on specific themes. This functionality is beneficial for keeping essential or favored websites, whether for a short duration or indefinitely.
